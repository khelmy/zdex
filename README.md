## Run with Scilla Compiler (Docker)

### Typechecking

Start Docker.

The first time you typecheck, from the Scilla root folder, run:
```
docker build -t scilla .
```

From then on, from the ZDEX root folder, to typecheck the ZDExchange contract, run:
```
. typecheck.bash contracts/ZDExchange.scilla
```

To typecheck the FungibleToken contract, run:
```
. typecheck.bash contracts/FungibleToken.scilla
```
